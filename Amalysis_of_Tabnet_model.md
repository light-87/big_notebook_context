## **üîç Model Behavior Analysis**

### **Overfitting Assessment**
- **Training F1**: 0.8697
- **Test F1**: 0.7431
- **Generalization Gap**: 0.1266 (‚ö†Ô∏è High)

**Analysis**: Despite hyperparameter tuning focused on regularization, TabNet still shows concerning overfitting. The 12.7% performance drop from training to test suggests the model memorizes training patterns rather than learning generalizable features.

### **Optimal Configuration**
The best configuration reveals important insights:
- **lambda_sparse: 0.01** - Moderate regularization was optimal
- **n_steps: 2** - Simpler architecture performed better
- **lr: 0.005** - Slow learning rate necessary for stability
- **n_d/n_a: 16/16** - Smaller capacity reduced overfitting
- **batch_size: 512** - Larger batches improved generalization
