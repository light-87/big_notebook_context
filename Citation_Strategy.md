"Protein phosphorylation dysregulation drives some of humanity's most devastating diseases, with phosphorylation-controlled molecular switches determining cellular life-or-death decisions in cancer progression [1]. In neurological diseases, CDK4 levels increase significantly in Alzheimer's patients' brains, while hyperphosphorylated tau protein directly triggers neuronal death [2,3]. The pharmaceutical industry has responded with 37 kinase inhibitors currently in neurological clinical trials [4], yet the path to treatment remains expensive and uncertain.

Current drug discovery faces a crisis of economics and efficiency, with average development costs reaching $2.558-2.87 billion per approved drug over 13.5-year timelines [5,6]. Despite this enormous investment, only 10% of drugs entering clinical trials achieve market approval [7], while successful cancer treatments cost patients $17,900-44,000 monthly [8]. This inefficiency persists even as the global kinase inhibitor market grows toward $114 billion by 2033 [9], with pharmaceutical companies investing $83 billion annually in R&D [10].

Major technology companies recognize this opportunity, with Google's Isomorphic Labs raising £182 million and spending £49 million on R&D in 2023 alone [12,13], securing partnerships worth $2.9 billion with pharmaceutical giants [14]. Their AlphaFold3 system represents the current state-of-the-art in protein structure prediction [15], with ambitious goals to 'solve all diseases' using AI [16]. Yet despite years of development and billions in funding, these systems are only now preparing for first human trials [17]."
