\chapter*{Abstract}

Protein phosphorylation dysregulation drives some of humanity's most devastating diseases, with phosphorylation-controlled molecular switches determining cellular life-or-death decisions in cancer progression. In neurological diseases, dysregulated phosphorylation affects key proteins including tau, TDP-43, and alpha-synuclein, driving Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis progression. Despite pharmaceutical companies investing \$83 billion annually in R\&D, drug discovery faces a crisis of economics and efficiency, with average development costs reaching \$2.87 billion per approved compound over 13.5-year timelines. Current computational methods for phosphorylation site prediction suffer from poor generalization and lack of standardized benchmarks, limiting their clinical utility.

This research addresses these critical limitations through a comprehensive evaluation of machine learning and transformer-based approaches for protein phosphorylation site prediction. Using a balanced dataset of 62,120 samples across 7,511 proteins, the study systematically evaluated over 30 model-feature combinations spanning five feature engineering approaches: amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, physicochemical properties, binary encoding, and tripeptide composition. Advanced ensemble methods and novel transformer architectures based on the ESM-2 protein language model were developed and rigorously compared.

The research achieved breakthrough performance with a transformer architecture (TransformerV1) reaching 80.25\% F1 score, representing the first model to exceed 80\% accuracy on this challenging prediction task. A soft voting ensemble combining transformer models achieved 81.60\% F1 score, establishing new state-of-the-art performance. Physicochemical features emerged as the most predictive, achieving 78.03\% F1 with traditional machine learning while enabling 67\% dimensionality reduction. These achievements were accomplished using only personal computing resources, demonstrating that world-class performance is achievable without billion-dollar investments, thereby democratizing access to cutting-edge medical AI and accelerating drug discovery for diseases affecting millions worldwide.
