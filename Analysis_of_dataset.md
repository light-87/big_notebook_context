This comprehensive dataset forms the foundation for the machine learning and transformer-based approaches evaluated in this phosphorylation site prediction research.

Here's a detailed summary of the provided data processing and analysis logs.

### Section 1: Data Merging, Validation, and Preparation 📝

The initial data processing began with the merging and validation of data. From **7,511 original sequences** and **31,349 original labels**, **31,073** were successfully merged. This resulted in **7,510 proteins** with phosphorylation data. The data underwent rigorous validation, with **zero** missing values, invalid amino acids, out-of-bounds positions, or duplicate entries detected.

To create a balanced dataset, **31,047 negative samples** were generated to match the **31,073 positive samples**, resulting in a nearly perfect balance ratio of **0.999**. The final dataset contains a total of **62,120 rows**. The final data quality report confirms the dataset's integrity, with **zero** errors and a class distribution of **50.0%** for both positive and negative samples. The dataset includes **7,510 proteins** with an average of **8.3 sites per protein**, and it uses approximately **633.5 MB** of memory.

### Section 3: Data Splitting Strategy 📊

This section details the creation of training, validation, and testing sets. The data was split based on a **protein-based strategy** to prevent data leakage. The **7,510 unique proteins** were divided into the following proportions:
* **Train Set:** **5,257 proteins** (70.0%)
* **Validation Set:** **1,126 proteins** (15.0%)
* **Test Set:** **1,127 proteins** (15.0%)

This protein distribution resulted in the following sample sizes for each split:
* **Train Set:** **42,845 samples** (69.0%)
* **Validation Set:** **9,153 samples** (14.7%)
* **Test Set:** **10,122 samples** (16.3%)

A critical validation check confirmed **zero protein leakage** between the splits, ensuring the independence of the datasets. The class balance was successfully maintained across all splits:
* **Train Set:** **50.0%** positive samples, **50.0%** negative samples.
* **Validation Set:** **50.1%** positive samples, **49.9%** negative samples.
* **Test Set:** **50.0%** positive samples, **50.0%** negative samples.

Additionally, a **5-fold cross-validation** setup was created for machine learning models, with the statistics for each fold provided. The final data splits and feature matrices, with a total of **9,892 features**, were saved to a checkpoint for use in subsequent sections. The final memory usage after this process was **9197.1 MB**.
