# Comprehensive Analysis of Section 7: Ensemble Techniques

## Overview and Motivation

Section 7 focused on implementing sophisticated ensemble methods to combine predictions from multiple models, leveraging the diversity identified in Section 6 error analysis. The section evolved through three major phases:
